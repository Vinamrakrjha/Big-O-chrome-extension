A chrome extension that shows time and space complexity of different algorithms and different data structure operations.
This extensions helps in remembering the time and space complexities, which is a very useful tool specially when you've a coding interview near-by.
& also it has a complexity graph in "options" section, so that one can know how well their code is in terms of time and space complexity
